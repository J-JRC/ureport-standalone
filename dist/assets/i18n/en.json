    "ANSWER_AUTOANALYZE_1" : "Auto analysis is one of the key feature UReport offers. User does not need to setup anything. it is on by default and cannot be turn off.<br> When user mark a fail test as an issue type, if the marked test case failed in the future for the same reason, UReport will automatically mark the test as Investigated and indicate with the symbol <i class='fas fa-microscope c-investigated' ></i>.<br> UReport will search back, by default, 30 days for all investigated issues within the same product and type. <br> This day number can be changed in the Settings.<hr> <br><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>When save failed test case through API, there are three fields user can provide: ",
    "ANSWER_AUTOANALYZE_2" : "To allow the auto analysis to work. <u>error_message</u> must be provided. This is the field UReport uses to achieve the auto analysis.<br>To allow a percise auto analysis result, field <u>token</u> is recommended. Because a error message might contain dynamic value that vary from execution. <br> <br> <u>Then what is token? </u><br> A token is a string field that is totally up to the user to set. <br> For example, if you are using a framework from Java, it won't be very hard to generate a string of number based on the line number of the failure from stack trace. <br> Such number sequence can be used as your unique token. If the error message contains dynamic value such as date, providing the token will make the auto-analysis more accureate.<br><br><u> Note: UReport does not genreate the token, it is up to the user to provide the value</u><br> <ul><li>When field <u>token</u> is present, <u>token</u> will be used for auto-analysis</li><li>When only field <u>error_message</u> is present, <u>error_message</u> will be used for auto-analysis</li><li>When only field <u>stack_trace</u> is present, <u>stack_trace</u> will be used for auto-analysis</li><li>The precedence of the fileds is:  token > error_message > stack_trace </li><li>When all three fileds are missing from a fail test, false will be return for all analysis.</li></ul>",
    "QUESTION_UID" : "What is a UID from the test?",
    "ANSWER_UID": "UID stands for unique ID. It could be a number or string or the combination of both. The point is to have such unique ID mapped to each of the automation test. <br> To make the auto anaylsis work, UReport need to have a way to identify the uniqueness of each test, by providing a unique id when sending test run results to the UReport server, it will enable UReport to work normally.<br> You will find this UID field everywhere when using API. <br> If your orgnization is using any testing management tool such as TestRail, PractiTest or HP ALM, you won't have trouble finding a unique number associated with any test you create. You can use this id to link with your automation run and then send this info to the UReport server.<br> Even if your orgnization does not use any test management tool, you can still assign some unique string or number to your automation. You just need to make sure they don't change after it is decided.",
